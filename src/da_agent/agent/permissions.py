"""Permission handling.

The `can_use_tool` callback is the SDK's gate before a tool runs. We use it for the
two built-in tools that need a human:

- **AskUserQuestion**: the model surfaces a multiple-choice question; we drive our own
  UI, then return the user's selections to the model via `updated_input.answers`.
- **ExitPlanMode**: when the agent finishes planning we surface the plan for approval
  and, on accept, relax the permission mode.

Spec §8.2 — when the question's first sub-question carries `header == "Target"`,
the web path additionally validates the (Target, Source) pair, rotates the
previous `v_curr` to `v_prev` for KB/attachment writes, and returns the
resolved absolute write path inside `updated_input` so the model writes to it
verbatim. CLI usage passes `resolve_target=None` and skips that hop.

Everything else is allowed (this is a trusted, single-user local tool; all steps
are still shown in the TUI for transparency).
