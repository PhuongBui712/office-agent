"""Async orchestrator for the new memory-driven KB ingestion pipeline.

Successor to `kb.runner`. Status flow:

    PENDING -> PROFILING -> READY              (memory file written)
                       \\-> READY_PARTIAL       (profiler failed; raw.xlsx still usable)
                       \\-> FAILED              (catastrophic; e.g. raw.xlsx missing)

A failed profiler does NOT block KB usability — the main agent can still
fall back to the xlsx skill against `raw.xlsx`. We only emit FAILED when the
upload itself is unrecoverable (file missing, registry crash, etc.).
